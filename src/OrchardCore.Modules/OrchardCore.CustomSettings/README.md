# Custom Settings (OrchardCore.CustomSettings)

## Usage

Custom Settings allows a site administrator to create a customized set of properties that are global to the web sites. These settings are 
edited in the standard Settings section and can be protected with specific permissions.

### Creating Custom Settings

Custom Settings are organized in sections. Each section is represented by a Content Type with the `CustomSettings` stereotype.
When creating such section, remember to disable `Creatable`, `Listable`, `Draftable` and `Securable` metadata as they don't apply.

!!! warning
    Don't mark and existing Content Type with this `CustomSettings` stereotype as this will break exsiting content items of this type.

Custom Settings are then comprised of parts and fields like any other content type. Once created, open the Setting menu item and each
of these sections should appear alongside the module provided ones.

### Permissions

Each Custom Settings sections gets a dedicated permission to allow specific users to edit them.

To edit this permission open the Roles editor and go to the OrchardCore.CustomSettings Feature group.

### Templates

The Custom Settings like other settings are available in the `{{ Site.Properties }}` object. Each section is made available
using its name. 

For instance accessing the `BodyPart` of a custom settings section named `BlogSettings` would be accessible using `{{ Site.Properties.BlogSettings.BodyPart }}`.
